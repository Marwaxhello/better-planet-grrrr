                    We believe that climate-tech startups have the power to make a
                    significant positive social impact on a large scale. We want to help
                    these startups get on their feet, faster. That’s why we’re investing
                    €50.000 in a startup fund, providing promising pioneers with the tools
                    they need to push their mission further.

                    digital creative agency with a B-Corp certificate, and our focus on
                    impact strategy, inclusive design and ethical tech has been recognised
                    with 33 international awards and nominations. Seeing our work realised
                    in the success of companies like The Ocean Cleanup (with xx result),
                    Fastned (with xx result) and SkyNRG (with xx result) is what keeps us

                <p class="body-1">
                    The startup fund was born from our mission: helping all organisations
                    become more meaningful, regardless of where they’re at on their impact
                    journey. We took this one step further.

                <p class="body-1">
                    Design goes beyond what looks nice. It’s your brand's personality; how
                    it looks, talks, reacts and interacts with people. Good design can make
                    a brand easier to understand, to use, more memorable and more
                    accessible. It gets your mission across and your message out there.
                    That’s why we're funding climate-tech startups; we want to give them the
                    power to stand out, to make even more impact, to be even more
                    successful, and ultimately, to build towards a more sustainable future.
